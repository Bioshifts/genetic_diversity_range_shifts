Here we test if genetic diversity affects species range shifts.

To test this hypothesis, we use species range shift data from Bioshifts ([Comte et al. 2020](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/BioShifts_a_global_geodatabase_of_climate-induced_species_redistribution_over_land_and_sea/7413365)) and genetic diversity data published in [Fonseca et al. 2023 Evo Letters](https://academic.oup.com/evlett/article/7/5/331/7226644).

Range shift data was gathered across scientific and peer-reviewed literature reporting climate-driven range shifts under contemporary climate change. Here, we focus on latitudinal range shifts.

Mitochondrial DNA was used for vertebrates, arachnids, and insects, while chloroplast DNA was used for plants. Using these data, nucleotide diversity (π) was calculated to describe patterns of intraspecific genetic diversity. Hereafter, we refer to nucleotide diversity as genetic diversity (GD).
